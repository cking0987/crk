        <h2>My name is Chuck King.</h2>
        <p>I'm a creative strategist and digital innovator</p>
        <p>What does that even mean? üßê I'm a tech nerd who is actually just an all-around nerd. I have very few qualifications but I make up for that with my insatiable curiosity and lust for failure.</p>
        <p>I like to design things and then build them. I do websites, apps, print design, and real-life things that don't have any pixels at all. If you want to see some of them, why didn't you say so in the first place? Head on over to <em>observe</em>.</p>
