## who, me?

As you may have guessed from the URL, my name is Charles Richard King. I go by Chuck, Charlie, Charles, and Little Chicky. Pick your favorite. I use he/him pronouns.

I'm a creative strategist and digital innovator

What does that even mean? üßê I'm a tech nerd who is actually just an all-around nerd. I have very few qualifications but I make up for that with my insatiable curiosity and lust for failure.

I like to design things and then build them. I do websites, apps, print design, and real-life things that don't have any pixels at all. If you want to see some of them, why didn't you say so in the first place? Head on over to [observe](/observe/).
