My name is Charles Richard King. I was named after this website. I also go by Chuck, Charlie, and Little Chicky. Pick your favorite. I use he/him pronouns.

I'm a creative strategist and digital innovator. What do those words even mean? üßê I'm a tech nerd who is actually just an all-around nerd. I have very few qualifications but I make up for that with my insatiable curiosity and lust for failure.

I like to design things and then build them. I do websites, apps, print design, and real-life things that don't have any pixels at all.
